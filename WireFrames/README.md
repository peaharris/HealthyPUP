## Login
 
This is where the User logs in. User must specify an email address and password. The UserName is the user's email.

Technical Assumption: Everyone's email address is unique. This is  all that we need to isolate an individual user.

Once the user successfully logs in, the user will be taken to the [List Of Pets Page](ListOfPetsPage.md) page.
